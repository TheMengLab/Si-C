# Si-C
Single-Cell Chromosome Conformation Calculator

The respository includes the code and script to construct and analyze intact genome 3D structure from single-cell Hi-C data.
Details of construct intact genome structure are described in the repository Si-C/modeling/README.md
For structure analysis, codes are structure analysis are deposed at Si-C/analysis/structure_analysis with details described in the file  Si-C/analysis/structure_analysis/README
