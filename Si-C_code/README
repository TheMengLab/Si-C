1.Introduction
The repository contains the codes and script used by Si-C method to construct high-resolution intact genome structures from single-cell Hi-C data. The code is written by C and the script is written in bash.
Both the source code and the compiled code are presented in the repository. 




2.Repo Contents
contact: repository for mapping single-cell Hi-C contacts to pairs of chromatin bins.
3D_simulation: repository for calculating intact genome structures based on single-cell Hi-C data.
get3Dstructure.sh: bash script for calculating 3D genome structures.

To obtain the modeled structures, the shell script get3Dstructure.sh is used. Before running the script, input data and parameters need to be explained.

On the top row of the script get3Dstructure.sh, there are several lines like

chrnum=20       # The number of chromosome, including X chromosome
finalres=100    # Resolution of final structure
HiCdata=./GSM2219497_Cell_1_contact_pairs.txt   #Hi-C data
chrlenfile=./chrlenlist.dat     #file containing the chromosome length
repnum=2        #Number of structure replicas to generate

These lines contains the information of input data for calculation. 
chrnum: represents the number of individual chromosomes in each cell(the number is 20 for mESC haploid cell)
finalres: represnets the target resolution of modeled structure. The value of 100 means each bead in modeled 3D structure represent chromatin region of 100-kb size
HiCdata: the file name for experimental Hi-C. Please be careful with the format Hi-C data.
chrlenfile: the file cotains the genomic length of each chromosome. The reference genome of chromosome length should be consistent of Hi-C data. The list should be sorted according to the identities of chromosomes
repnum: the number of structure replicas to generate. 

You may need to change the values in these top lines when calculate 3D structures using your own data.




3.System Requirements
The code is tested on Linux operating systems with the system Ubuntu 16.04
It requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the calculation. We recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 8+ GB
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.2+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (8 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.2 GHz).




4.Installation Guide
awk and mysql are required before running the script, which can be installed by 

sudo apt-get install mawk
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

it may take serveral minutes to finish the installation



5.Demo
Just run the script get3Dstructure.sh with the command

bash get3Dstructure.sh

The calculation is performed in background. It takes about 3 hours to finish the calculation. You can use the command top to check whether the calculation has ended.


6.Results
After the ending of the script, the generated genome structures are presented as ./3D_simulation/100kb_2replica/1/genome.pdb, ./3D_simulation/100kb_2replica/2/genome.pdb ....
