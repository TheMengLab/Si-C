1.Introduction
The repository contains the codes and script used by Si-C method to construct high-resolution intact genome structures from single-cell Hi-C data. The code is written by C and the script is written in bash.
There 



The repository contains the codes and script demonstrateing the 3D structure calculation.

To obtain the modeled structures, the shell script get3Dstructure.sh is used. Before running the script, input data and parameters need to be explained.

On the top row of the script get3Dstructure.sh, there are several lines like

chrnum=20       # The number of chromosome, including X chromosome
finalres=100    # Resolution of final structure
HiCdata=./GSM2219497_Cell_1_contact_pairs.txt   #Hi-C data
chrlenfile=./chrlenlist.dat     #file containing the chromosome length
repnum=10        #Number of structure replicas to generate


These lines contains the information of input data for calculation. 
chrnum represents the number of individual chromosomes in each cell(the number is 20 for mESC haploid cell)
finalres represnets the target resolution of modeled structure. The value of 100 means each bead in modeled 3D structure represent chromatin region of 100-kb size
HiCdata is the filename for experimental Hi-C. Please be careful with the format Hi-C data.
chrlenfile is the file cotains the genomic length of each chromosome. The reference genome of chromosome length should be consistent of Hi-C data. The list should be sorted according to the identities of chromosomes
repnum is the number of structure replicas to generate. The value can be set to 10 or 20.




After setting the parameters, you can perform the calculation by the command
bash get3Dstructure.sh
