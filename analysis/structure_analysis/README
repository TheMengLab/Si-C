Genome structure analysis scripts

This repository contains an bash shell script which demonstrates the following analysis into the modeled 3D structures of 10-kb resolution


Calculate the distance matrix between bins in the region of chromosome 1 30Mb-40Mb in modeled 20 structure replicas. The output distance matrix file is ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/distmatrix/chr1_30Mb_40Mb/distmatrix.dat. The logarithm of distance (the unit of distance is bead diameter) is saved in the output file.


Calculate the intermingling between inter-chromosome bins. The output intermingle file is ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/intermingle/intermingle.dat, each row of which represents the percentage of bins in each chromosome that intermingle with other chromosome.


Calculate the root mean square deviation between 20 structure replicas. The output file is ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/rmsd/rmsdmatrix_mirror.dat, in the format of 20*20 matrix. Elements in the matrix represent the RMSD between two structures after the alignment of translocation, rotation and mirror image.



Calculate the gyration radius for all 200-kb chromatin regions and the gyration radius value is assigned to the center bead. The output gyration radius data for 20 chromosomes are saved in 20 files ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/sepscore_gyr/gyr_chr*.dat. 



Calculate the separation score for each chromosome bead. The output separation score for 20 chromosomes are saved in 20 files ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/sepscore_gyr/sepscore_chr*.dat. 



Identify the genomic positions for domain boundaries in genome structure in single cell. The output boundary positions in 20 chromosomes are saved in 20 files ./structure_analysis/analysis/align/sepscore_gyr/boundary_chr/boundary_chr*.dat. The data in the first column represents the position of identified boundary(in the unit of 10kb). The data in the second column represents the separation score for the boundary bead.



Bash shell and awk are needed to perform the calculation. Commands used for structure calculation are

cd structure_analysis/analysis/
bash doall.sh
cd ../..
